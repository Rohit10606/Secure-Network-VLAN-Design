# Secure Network Topology Design (Cisco Packet Tracer) 
Designed a segemented enterprise-style network using VLAN architecture to enhance internal security and traffic isolation. This project demonstrates secure network infrastructure planning and implemention using Cisco IOS CLI.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
VLAN Segmentation: Isolated departmental traffic (Admin, Finance, and CS) to ensure network security.
Inter-VLAN Routing: Configured Router-on-a-Stick with sub-interfaces and 802.1Q encapsulation to allow controlled communication between VLANs.
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Implemented security rules to control inter-departmental communication.
Subnetting Strategy: Developed an efficient IP addressing and subnetting strategy to improve network scalability.
DHCP Services: Configured automated IP assignment using router-based DHCP Pools for different subnets.

📊 VERIFICATION & PROOF
Connectivity: Verified end-to-end communication via ICMP ping tests across different subnets.
CLI Validation: Configuration verified using show running-config and show ip interface brief commands.
